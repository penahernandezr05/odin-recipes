    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds chicken wings</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a shallow baking dish with aluminum foil and grease lightly. </li>
        <li>Cut off chicken wing tips and discard. Cut between the joints to separate each wing into two pieces. </li>
        <li>Heat butter and garlic in a small saucepan over low heat until butter is melted and garlic is fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Mix Parmesan cheese, parsley, oregano, paprika, salt, and pepper together in a shallow bowl. </li>
        <li>Dip chicken wing pieces into melted butter mixture, then press into Parmesan mixture to coat all over. Arrange in the prepared baking dish. Drizzle any remaining butter on top. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, the juices run clear, and the skin is browned, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
    </ol>
